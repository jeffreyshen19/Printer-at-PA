    p
      | We have a Direct-to-Garment printer (fancy words for a t-shirt printer) that has been brought to Andover for you to use. It prints custom designs onto items like t-shirts, sweatshirts, and even towels and tote bags.
      br
      br
      |The purpose of The Printer is to provide students with a cheaper, faster, and easier method to print custom items. Any Andover student knows that CustomInk is often prohibitively expensive and takes two weeks to process an order. The Printer takes the guessing out of the game and allows students to print a range of 1 shirt to 60 shirts at any given time for less money. If your club or team gains a new member, you can always return to the Printer and print another one in under five minutes.

      a(href = "mailto:laaron@andover.edu") ask us
      | &nbsp;and we'll explain the simple process in 5-10 minutes, or&nbsp;

    h3 Why Us?
    ul
      li Faster: With 150-second print-times, you can be in and out with brand new shirts in minutes.
      li Cheaper: We guarantee $50 savings over Customink for orders of 60 or less.
      li Easier: Located in the basement of the library and managed by classmates, the Printer allows for great flexibility. Never worry about ordering just the right number of items, as you can always print more. Payment is carried out by Bluecard.
