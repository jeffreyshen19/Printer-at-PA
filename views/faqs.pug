      li.q Why do we have a t-shirt printer?

        | Thanks to a grant from the Abbot Academy Association, students Louis Aaron ’18, Sam Bloom ’18, and Jeffrey Shen ’19 were able to bring the printer to campus in January 2017. It’s purpose is to provide students, clubs, sports teams, and other on-campus groups with inexpensive custom apparel. CustomInk is oftentimes three times as expensive as we are!

      li.q Why are the shirts so much less expensive?
        i.fa.fa-chevron-down
      li.a
        | Our shirts are always made from the highest quality materials and printed on the industry’s best and most modern Direct-to-Garment printer. We are able to charge less because our goal is not to make money, but to save you money! Our costs are just the costs of the materials (no employee or CEO salaries to pay :-).
